    <!-- This fifth section is about the movies that these animals have made-->
    <section>
        <h5>What Do Famous Animals Eat?</h5>
        <p>Bugs Bunny eats carrots, though rabbits can also eat those. I think Air Bud maybe eats a cake in one of them?
            I
            don't remember. Honestly I haven't seen that one in years. Beethoven definitely eats something meant for
            humans.
