            <h4>Do Animals Eat Food?</h4>
            <p>There have been many famous animals throughout history that do eat human food, like Bugs Bunny, Air Bud,
                and
                Beethoven.</p>

            <p> Other famous animals</p>

                <ul>Porky Pig</ul>

        <section>
            <h5>What Do Famous Animals Eat?</h5>
            <p>Bugs Bunny eats carrots, though rabbits can also eat those. I think Air Bud maybe eats a cake in one of
                them?
                I
                don't remember. Honestly I haven't seen that one in years. Beethoven definitely eats something meant for
                humans.
