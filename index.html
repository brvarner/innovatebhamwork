    <!-- This first section will have my name-->
    <h1>This</h1>
    <p>My name is Brandon Varner, and this is the funny animals/good food page.</p>
    <!--This second section will have my cat's name-->
    <h2>Is</h2>
    <p>My cat's name is Katsu, but he's not quite a famous animal. Though he eats cat food, I usually eat human food.</p>
    <!-- This third section will be about foods I like-->
    <h3>A</h3>
    <p>Human food like pizza, impossible whoppers, salads, steamed vegetables, fried rice, and more. These are only a few of the foods I eat, but you get the idea.</p>
    <!--This fourth section is about famous animals-->
    <h4>Hilarious</h4>
    <p>There have been many famous animals throughout history that do eat human food, like Bugs Bunny, Air Bud, and Beethoven.</p>
    <!-- This fifth section is about the movies that these animals have made-->
    <h5>Heading</h5>
    <p>Bugs Bunny eats carrots, though rabbits can also eat those. I think Air Bud maybe eats a cake in one of them? I don't remember. Honestly I haven't seen that one in years. Beethoven definitely eats something meant for humans.</p>
    <!-- This last section is about what makes these animals so heroic-->
    <h6>Set</h6>
    <p>Regardless of what they eat, these famous creatures have done wonders for the advancement of human society.</p>
